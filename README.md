Project name :Model Ensemble for Medical Image Segmentation
We find data from https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb.
we prepare the dataset, perform cutting, padding, and normalization, and split the data to prepare for subsequent training.

This dataset provides a rich resource for exploring segmentation and classification tasks in cardiac MRI analysis. The challenge dataset is widely used for benchmarking and testing new methods in the field of medical image segmentation. By participating in this project, we leverage the dataset to explore model ensembles and their impact on performance in segmentation tasks.
